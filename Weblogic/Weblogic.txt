----------------------------------
Q. Claim registration related issues?
=> 	some time delar unable to register the claim 
    there are several reason due to which claim registration fails 
	In that case i need to check error message is getting in the response 
	based on error message i need to take further action to resolve the issue 
	For example 
	1. delear sying i am getting error like workshop id is not available hence 
	   claim is not registerd
	=> solution:- take the workshop details from delear and map those workshop 
	   details in the database 
	   - To map workshop details I prepare insert query 
	     get approve from TL and execute DML statemet 
    
	2. some time delear says i registered the claim but claim number is not received 
	=> solution:- cross check entry in the database against given policy number 
				  if claim is available then share that number 
				  if claim is not generated then check what response we have sent 
				  to delear in 'ws_logs' table 
    
	3. Some times delealer get response like "Policy/Cover Note Number does not

				 2. size of document(less than 20MB)
				 
   2. some times our internal user unable to view the uploaded document?
   => solution:- Uploaded document stored at server directory from that 
				directory documents moved to another location through 
				omini utility.if user unable to view them then i need to 
				check omini utility status with the help of omini team 
				because omini utility handled by omini team 
				then i connect with omini team and get it resolved 
---------------------------
Q. Application slowness issue?
=> If there is applicatio slowness issue then i check 
	1. Long running process

    3. process which consume high memory 
	   ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem
	
	If required then i kill the process by taking approval from TL 
	To kill process syntax is :- kill -9 process id 
-------------------------------------	
Q. server space issue 
=> solution - check server space by using df,du,free command 
			- if there is space problem then i need to find unwanted files 
			  like back dated log files or unwanted files which has consumed 
			  high space for that file I need delete with approval

Q. Why you looking for job change?
-> For technical growth

Q. Technical growth means what?
-> Currently I am working on insurance domain but I want working
   on Banking and Telecom domain.
   
-> Here we are using less number of tools, I want to expore
   myself in term of tools also.
---------------------------
# I have hands on experience to write simple and complex
  SQL query.
Q> For which reason you write an SQL Query.
-> 1.Our Internal user ask for various reports, in that case I 
   write query to tetrive data from data base. Retived data
   export in excel and share to users.
   1. Delear wise claim Registration reports
   2. Delear wise claim Registration fail report reports
   3. Delear wise claim settle reports
   
-> 2. I write insert statement to map workshop details.
-> 3. I write update statement to unlock user account.
-> 4. I write update statement to user account password
-> 5. I DR I use select statement to cross check application
      is working or not.
----------------------------------------------------------
Q> What is mean by Incident?
-> An unwanted or unexpected event occured during the execution
   of process is nothing but incident.

  For Example : Suppose we have virutal meet with client after 15 min
  but our internate is down.
  
  For Example: Delear has registered the claim but in response claim
  number is received.
-------------------------------------------------
Q. What is mean by Incident management?
-> Providing alternative solution so that we can continue with rest of work
   is nothing but Incident management.
-> Example: One customer have reported an incident, I am unable to upload
   the documents on the Portal.
-> Alternate solution: Accept customer document on official mail id.

-> Example: Delear has registered the claim but in response claim
    number is not received.
-> Alternative Solution: Fetch the claim number from the database and share 
   to delear.
   
-> Incident management goal is to resolve the issue as quickly as possible 
   with temporary solution or with aternative soltion.
--------------------------------------------------
Q. What is Probelm?
-> If same incident is happing or occuring again and again then it becomes 
   problem

   Example : If frequently internate is going down. Frequently electricity 
   supply if off then it becomes problem
   
---------------------------------------------------
Q> What is problem Management?
-> Finding  the root cause and given permanent solution to fix the Problem
   is nothing but problem Management 
-----------------------------------------------------------  
# Priorities of an Incident
-> We have Priorities P1,P2,P3 and P4
   P1: Critical issue.
   P2: High Priority issue
   P3: Medium Priority issue
   P4: Lowest Priorities issue
   
Q. How we decide Priority of an issue and what is its SLA(Service Level 
   Aggreement)?
-> How much percent services are blocked and what is impact on the 
   business,based on that we decide Priority of an issue.
   
-> P1: Total applicaiton is down, total services of an applicaiton are 
       blocked.
	   If issue is of P1 type then we need to resolve within 2/3 hours 
	   or on same day.
	   
	  Example: No one is able to login  to system.
	  Example: No one delear is able to register the claim.
	  Example: For Every Delear not getting claim number in response.
	  Example: No one delear able to upload the documents.
	   
-> P2: If issue is of P2 type then we need to resolve on same day.
       Example: We have 5 delears, out of 5 Honda Delear Claim Registration
	   service is not working. We need to resolve that issue on same day.
	   
	   Example: We have 5 delears, out of 5 Honda Delear Document service
	   is not working. We need to resolve that issue on same day.
	   
-> P3: If issue if of P3 then we need to resolve within 2 days.
       Example: Suppose For Honda Delear.Chenai,New Delhi and Mumbai
	   Workshops unable to register claim or unble upload documents.
	   We need to resolve within 2 days.
	   
-> P4: If issue is P3 type then we need to resolve in 3/4 days.
       Example: One the Delear has registered claim but it is not 
	   settled.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Q. Who decides Priority of issue?
-> If ticket is directly assigned then all details are mentioned in the 
   ticket.
   
-> If there is direct mail from Delear and I need to raise ticket 
   then based on business impact I decide its Priority.
------------------------------------------------------------
# ITIL Change Request 
-> ITIL stands for Information Technology Infrastructure Library

Q. What is Change request?
-> We are updating application or application data manually.
-----------------------
Q. Process of Change request
1) Identification of Change or need for a change:
   change initiator should gather information about the current state of the system and create a detailed change request document. 
   That document describes the proposed change, the reasons for the change, and the impact of the change on the system.
   
2. Initial assessment and evaluation of the change 
-> In this step,change management authority team review the change request 
   document,check the its feasibility.
   The change management authority will assess the risks and benefits of the change.The change management authority can approve,reject or 
   ask for more information on the change request.
   
3. Implementation of the change
-> Once the change request is approved by the change management authority, 
   then IT Team responsible for implementing the change.
   
   The IT Team create a detailed plan for execution by filling 
   the change request form.
   
-> Steps carried out by Item Team.
   1) First we need to raise change request by filling form.
      In that Change request form we need to speacify information like
		1) Project Name
		2) Who has requested the change?
		3) why a change is necessary?
		3) What is priority and urgency of the change?
		4) Change category(standard, emergency, normal, etc)
		5) change type (minor, major, etc)
		4) What is business impact right now?
		5) What is benifit if we execute that change?
		6) Which module this change is required?
		7) Who is going to implement that change?
		8) Where that change is going to execute?
		9) What is implementation plan?
		10) What is recovery plan?
		11) Who is going approve this change request?
   2) Send for Approval
   3) Ones approved, execute it.
   
4. Review and closure of the change request
The review and closure of the change request is the final step in the ITIL change request process. This steps cross checking of changes and documenting
the results,and then closing the change request.
----------------------------------------------
Q. Give one example of Change request which you have executed
   
1) I have executed change request to make data in sync for 5000 claims.
   Our Application exchange data with Delear Application.
   Claim status should be same at both end. If there is mismatch in claim status then delear unable to register claim.
   Delear shared 5000 claims along with its status, we cross checked status at our 
   end and we found there is mismatch in the status.For those claim status updation
   I raised change request and executed.
   1) I take back up of 5000 claims.
   2) I prepared update query for 5000 claims
   3) Raised change request by mentioning required information and get 
      approved
   4) Executed that change request.
------------------------------------------------------
Example: I have executed Change Request to Map 100 workshop details.

Q. How will you troubleshoot when weblogic server fails to start?
=>- there are multiple reason for server fails to start 
  - some check point as below 
  1. check server logs for error message
  2. analysis common error message 
		- port conflicts
		- out of memory error 
		- database connection issue 
		- file/directory permission 
  3. verify java envirnoment
		- java version 
		- java home 
		- jvm parameter
  4. check configuration files for error 
  5. check network and database connectivity
  6. clear temporary and cache files 
  1. check server logs for error message 
  => If admin server is failing then check admin server log 
     admin server log stored in 'server/adminServer/log/'  
     - if managed server is failing then check manged server 
	   log 
  2. Analyze common error message 
	a) port conflicts:Error like "address already in use"
	solution: use netstate or lsof to find process using the port or configure 
	          weblogic to use a different port in config.xml file 
			- lsof command:- display process with port number			 
			
	b) Out of memory error : error like "java.hang.outofmemoryerror" indicate memory constraint 
	solution: increase heap memory in the server's startup configuration
				(-xms or -xmx parameter in setDomainEnv.sh)
	
	c) Database connection issue: Database connectivity issue or incorrect credentials 
	solution: verify the database server status,network accessibility and the 
				correctness of JDBC configuration
				which is present in config/jdbc directory
				
	
	d) file/directory permission: error like 'java.io.FileFoundationException' weblogic may not 
			not have necessary file or directory access 
	solution: Ensure weblogic has read/write permission on all necessary directories 
			Q. how to give permission of read/write?
			=> using chmod command => sudo chmod 777 file_name 
			
  3. Verify java envirnoment: 
		a) Java Version: confirm java version is compatible with your weblogic server 
		b) Java_home: check java_home and path point to valid jdk 
		c) jvm parameter: In setDomainEnv.sh verify jvm arguments,unsupported argument 
							can cause the JVM fails 

  4. check configuration files for error 
	a) config.xml : syntax error or incorrect value in config.xml file 
		solution: correct any error or rollback provious configuration 
		
	b) Starts scripts : Error in script like 'startWeblogic.sh' or 'startManagedWeblogic.sh'
						may also prevent backup 
       solution: review recent changes and restore any modified start script if necessary
  
  5. check network and database connectivity: 
		a) ping database and external services: ensure network access to external services 
				and databases that weblogic depend on 
		b) Firewall and network configuration: check firewall rule to network setting to 
			    ensure they aren't blocking access to critical resources 

   6. Clear temporary and cache files 
		corrupted temporary or cache files can prevent startup delete that file from 
		following directories
		$DOMAIN_HOME/servers/AdminServer/tmp/
		$DOMAIN_HOME/servers/AdminServer/cache/
		$DOMAIN_HOME/servers/AdminServer/data/
		These files will be recreated at the next startup attempt.
---------------------------------
Q. How would you handle an out-of-memory error in WebLogic? 
-> To handle an out-of-memory error in WebLogic, you can try these steps:
1. Increase the memory
   Modify the "setDomainEnv" script to increase the values of the USER_MEM_ARGS parameter. 
   -Xms1024m -Xmx4096m
   -Xms: Initial heap size
   -Xmx: Maximum heap size
   Note: default value are : -Xms256m -Xmx512m

   Server, including paths to Java and other required libraries.
   
5. startManagedWebLogic.sh / startManagedWebLogic.cmd
-> Location: C:\weblogic12c\user_projects\domains\base_domain\bin
-> Similar to startWebLogic, but specifically for starting Managed Servers.
-> Ensures that Managed Servers connect to the Admin Server upon 
   startup and inherit necessary domain configuration settings.
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
# nm_password.properties
Location:base_domain\config\nodemanager
This file contains the encrypted credentials (username and password) used by Node Manager to authenticate with WebLogic Server

By default, this file is generated when you start Node Manager for the first time and enter the credentials, or it may be generated during the WebLogic domain configuration if you set up Node Manager at that time

If Node Manager authentication is required for your setup, the credentials in nm_password.properties must match the username and password configured in the WebLogic Server's config.xml file for Node Manager access.

If we want to change username and password for nodemanager then 
edit nm_password.properties file 
username=
password=

ones nodemanager is started then user name and password get converted into
encrypted form as 
hashed={Algorithm\=SHA-256}93ZJmzERlrCXyVLaSqcLVuVT7SB5mM5WPB4xrTBdTiI\=

# Deploying an application in weblogic
1. start weblogic admin server
-> We can start weblogic admin server in two ways 
   1. by executing "startWeblogic.cmd or .sh file"
   2. Connect to nodemanager and start weblogic.
   
Q. How to start weblogic admin server in background?
-> start /B startWebLogic.cmd > weblogic.log 2>&1
-> nohup ./startWebLogic.sh > weblogic.out 2>&1 &

Q. How to start weblogic admin server in forground?
-> startWebLogic.cmd
-> startWebLogic.sh

2. Login to admin console 
-> http://locahost:7001/console
-> Go to development section
-> Browse an application which you want to deploy.
-> Choose installation type and scope
   Install this deployment as an application: If war file  
   Install this deployment as library: If jar file
   
->Select deployment targets and follow the subsequent steps
-----------------------------------------------
   
# Deployment modes in WebLogic
1. Stage Mode
In Stage mode, the application files are first copied (or staged) to each target server in the domain. This approach is useful when you have multiple Managed Servers in a cluster

Recommended when all Managed Servers are remote, or when each server should have its own copy of the application
--------------
2. Nostage Mode
In Nostage mode, application files are not copied to each Managed Server. Instead, the application is accessed from a central location where it is initially deployed.

3. External Stage Mode
In External Stage mode, the staging of the application files is managed outside of WebLogic (e.g., by a system administrator).
-------------
Choosing a Deployment Mode
1.Stage Mode: 
  Good for distributed production environments with multiple Managed Servers.

2. Nostage Mode: 
 Suitable for development or single-machine setups.

3. External Stage Mode: 
Ideal for environments needing specific control over file management.
