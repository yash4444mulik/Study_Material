	- Automatically assigned by DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
	- Dynamic IPs are temporary,cheaper and suitable for everyday users.
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is difference between Static IPs and Dynamic IPs?
==> Static IPs are manually assigned by device where as Dynamic IPs are automatically assigned by DHCP.
	- Static IP does not change over the time but dynamic IP changes each time the device reconnect to network.

-----------------------------------------------
Q.. Why class D and class E don't have default subnet mask?
==> We don't use class D and class E IP address for Network.
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is subnet?
==> - subnet stand for sub network.
	- It is smaller segment of larger network
	- It is created by dividing a bigger network into multiple smaller networks 
	- subnet are defined by subnet mask or CIDR notation.
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is subnet mask?
==> subnet mask is 32 bit number that defines which portion of IP address 
    refers to the Network and which portion refers to Host.
	- It is seperate network part and host part of IP address.
	- subnet mask use 1s to represent network portion and 0s to represent host portion.
	
	Example 255.0.0.0
	=> here first 8 bit refer to network portion 1s
			last 24 bit refer to host portion 0s
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is CIDR?
==> CIDR stand for classless Inter domain Routing.
	- It is method used to allocate and specify IP addresses and their associated routing prefix in 
	  a more flexible way than a old clas-based system
	- It is written as : IP Address/Prefix 
	- Prefix length tells how many bits are used for the network 
	- remaining bits are the host address 
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. How many IP address are possible in a network?
==> 
	1. 192.168.1.0/24
	=> number of network bit 24 
	   number of host bit 8
	   
	   Total IPs  = 2^ hotst bit 
				  = 2^8
				  = 2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2 
				  = 256
	   
	   Usable IPs = Total IPs - 2 
				  = 256-2 
				  = 254
				 
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. How to calculate number of hosts?
==> The number of hosts means total number of devices we can connect to network.
	
	Total Devices = 2^H-2 
		here H stand for host bits 
		2 is substracted because 
		One address is reserved for the network address
		One address is reserved for the broadcast address
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. How to find Network ID and Broadcast ID?
==> - To get Network ID we need to convert all host bits into 0 
	  192.168.1.0=> 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
	  Convert all host bit into 0 
	  => 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
	  => convert binary into decimal 192.168.1.0
	  => this is your Network ID 192.168.1.0
	  
	- To get Broadcast ID set all hots bits are to 1 
		192.168.1.0=> 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
		- convert all host bit into 1 
		=> 11000000.10101000.00000001.11111111
		=> convert binary to decimal 192.168.1.255
		=> this is your Broadcast ID 192.168.1.255

-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is mean by Virtulization?
==> Virtulization is process of constructing an abstract layer on top of Hardware 
	using software.
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is Virtual Machine(VM)?
==> Software based emulation of Physical machine.
	- Multiple VMs runs on single Physical Machine.
	- VMs are isolated from each other 
	- if one VM fails,no impact on other VMs
	- Each VM has its own OS called guest OS,which may differ from Host OS.
	- All VMs share same Physical resources CPU,RAM and storage but act like independent.
	==> Advantages of VM
		- Resources Sharing: All VMs share same Physical resources CPU,RAM and storage
		- Isolation: Each VM work independenly so if one VM fails then no impact on other VMs 
		- Flexibility: we can add or remove VMs based on your requirement
		- Portability: VMs can be moved or cloned.
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. How virtulization works?
==> Virtulization works by inserting hyperviser between hardware and OS.
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is hyperviser?
==> - Hypervisor is software or program that allows multiple VMs to run on single 
	  physical machine by sharing its CPU,RAM and storage.
	- Hypervisor=Trafic Controller.
	  Hypervisor decide how much CPU,RAM,STORAGE will get by each VM
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. Type of hyperviser?
==> There are 2 types of hyperviser
	1. Type 1 hyperviser
	2. Type 2 hyperviser
	
	1. Type 1 hyperviser
	=> - it is called bare metal hyperviser
	   - runs directly on Physical Hardware
	   - it is faster and more secure because no HOST OS in between 
	   - In real time bare metal hyperviser is used for virtulization
	   - Example: VMware,hyper-v,KVM,Xen
	   
		1. VMware is developed by VMware and widely used in enterprise data center.
		2. Hyper-v is developed by Miscrosoft. In windows hyper-v used for virtulization
		3. KVM stand for Kernel based virtual machines.Linux provide KVM hyperviser for virtulization.
		4. Xen is open source hyperviser and originally developed at cambridge University.
		   Now Xen is maintained by Linux Foundation(Xen project).Big cloud provider like AWS,citrix,oracle
		   uses Xen hyperviser.
		   AWS EC2(Elastic Cloud Compute) service initially runs on Xen now it moved on KVM(Nitro hyperviser)
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. Type 2 Hypervisor?
==> - It is also called Hosted Hypervisor
	- Run on top of existing operating system.
	- It is easy to use but slightly slow.
	- Student use this hyperviser for learning purpose.
	
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is difference between Type1 and Type2 hyperviser?
==> - Type 1 hyperviser is called as bare metal hyperviser where as 
	  Type 2 hyperviser is called hosted hyperviser.
	- Type 1 hyperviser runs directly on Physical hardware where as 
	  Type 2 hyperviser runs on the top of existing operating system 
	- Type 1 is more secure than Type 2 because Type 1 runs directly on Physical Hardware 
	- Type 1 is faster than Type 2 
	- Type 1 example: Vmare,Hyper-v,Xen,KVM 
	  Type 2 example: Virtualbox,VMware workstation
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. Type of Virtulization?
==> Type of Virtulization is based on which component is being abstracted.
	1. Server Virtulization
	2. Desktop Virtulization
	3. Application Virtulization
	4. Network Virtulization
	5. Storage Virtulization
	6. Data virtulization
	7. Operating System Virtulization
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. Server Virtulization?
==> In server Virtulization single physical machine split into multiple Virtual Machine 
	and each VM runs its own OS and apps 
	- Software used for server Virtulization are VMware,Hyper-,KVM,Xen
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. Desktop Virtulization?
==> - In desktop virtulization users are allowed to run desktop environment remotely from central server.
	- Software used for Desktop Virtulization are VDI(Virtual Desktop Invironment),citrix
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. Application Virtulization?
==> - In Application Virtulization application is isolated from underlying os 
-----------------------------------------------
