-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is cloud service model?
==> The services offered by service provide to customer is nothing but cloud service model.
	- We have 3 type of cloud service model
		1. IaaS 
		2. PaaS
		3. SaaS
	
	1. IaaS: 
		- IaaS stand for infrastructure as a service.
		- It provides virtulized computing resources like server,storage and networking
		- Insted of buying hardware,we rent them from service provider 
		- Customer is responsible for maintain Infrastructure.
		- Example: AWS EC2(Elastic compute compute),Azure VM(Virtual Machine),Google Compute Engine(GCE)
		
	2. PaaS: 
		- PaaS stand Platform as a service.
		- It Provide platform for building,testing and deploying an application 
		- Service provider provides infrastructure and maintaining that infrastructure
		- Being customer we need to develope and deploy our application provider will handle O.S patch,
		  load balancing and monitoring
		- Example: Google App Engine,AWS Beanstalk,Microsoft Azure App service.
	
	3. SaaS:

	- There are 4 deployment models 
		1. Public cloud 
		2. Private cloud
		3. Hybrid cloud
		4. Multi cloud 
		
	1. Public cloud:

	2. Private Cloud: 
		- Private cloud is owned and managed by Perticular oraganization and accessible 
		  only for oraganization users 
	
	3. Hybrid Cloud:

	- Public means other devices in the world can reach you using this IP.
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. Private IP address?
==> - Defined by IANA(Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) for internal use 
	- Assigned by Router/DHCP inside the network.
	- A private IP is the IP address assigned to devices inside a local/private network.
	- It is not routable on internet directly only work within the internal network.
	- A private IP is used inside local networks and cannot be accessed directly from the internet.
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is difference between Public and Private IP address?
==> - Public IP are assigned by ISP where as Private IP assigned by Router/DHCP

-----------------------------------------------
Q.. Static IP?
==> - Does not change over the time.
	- Manually assigned to a device.
	- Useful for Servers,Printer,router
	- Static IPs are not permanent and ideal for hosting services 
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. Dynamic IPs?
==> Change each time the device reconnects to the network.
	- Automatically assigned by DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
	- Dynamic IPs are temporary,cheaper and suitable for everyday users.
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is difference between Static IPs and Dynamic IPs?
==> Static IPs are manually assigned by device where as Dynamic IPs are automatically assigned by DHCP.
	- Static IP does not change over the time but dynamic IP changes each time the device reconnect to network.

-----------------------------------------------
Q.. Why class D and class E don't have default subnet mask?
==> We don't use class D and class E IP address for Network.
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is subnet?
==> - subnet stand for sub network.
	- It is smaller segment of larger network
	- It is created by dividing a bigger network into multiple smaller networks 
	- subnet are defined by subnet mask or CIDR notation.
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is subnet mask?
==> subnet mask is 32 bit number that defines which portion of IP address 
    refers to the Network and which portion refers to Host.
	- It is seperate network part and host part of IP address.
	- subnet mask use 1s to represent network portion and 0s to represent host portion.
	
	Example 255.0.0.0
	=> here first 8 bit refer to network portion 1s
			last 24 bit refer to host portion 0s
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. What is CIDR?
==> CIDR stand for classless Inter domain Routing.
	- It is method used to allocate and specify IP addresses and their associated routing prefix in 
	  a more flexible way than a old clas-based system
	- It is written as : IP Address/Prefix 
	- Prefix length tells how many bits are used for the network 
	- remaining bits are the host address 
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. How many IP address are possible in a network?
==> 
	1. 192.168.1.0/24
	=> number of network bit 24 
	   number of host bit 8
	   
	   Total IPs  = 2^ hotst bit 
				  = 2^8
				  = 2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2 
				  = 256
	   
	   Usable IPs = Total IPs - 2 
				  = 256-2 
				  = 254
				 
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. How to calculate number of hosts?
==> The number of hosts means total number of devices we can connect to network.
	
	Total Devices = 2^H-2 
		here H stand for host bits 
		2 is substracted because 
		One address is reserved for the network address
		One address is reserved for the broadcast address
-----------------------------------------------
Q.. How to find Network ID and Broadcast ID?
==> - To get Network ID we need to convert all host bits into 0 
	  192.168.1.0=> 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
	  Convert all host bit into 0 
	  => 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
	  => convert binary into decimal 192.168.1.0
	  => this is your Network ID 192.168.1.0
	  
	- To get Broadcast ID set all hots bits are to 1 
		192.168.1.0=> 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
		- convert all host bit into 1 
		=> 11000000.10101000.00000001.11111111
		=> convert binary to decimal 192.168.1.255
		=> this is your Broadcast ID 192.168.1.255
