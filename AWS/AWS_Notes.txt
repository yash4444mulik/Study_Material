Q.. What is Cloud computing?
==> Using IT services or resources over the internet instead of buying and maintaining yourself.
------------------------------------------------
Q.. What is Cloud infrastructure?
==> The complete set of Hardware and Software resources used to deliver services over the internate
------------------------------------------------
Q.. What are cloud services model?
==> Cloud services model defines which kind of services offered by service provider to customer
	- we have 3 service model 
		1. IaaS
		2. PaaS
		3. SaaS
		
	1. IaaS
		- IaaS stand for Infrastructure as a service
		- It provides virtualized computing resources like server,storage and Networking
		- Instead of buying hardware we rent them from service provider 
		- customer is responsible to maintain the infrastructure
		- Exmple : AWS EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud),Azure VM(Virtual Machine),Google Compute Engine(GCE)
		
	2. PaaS
		- PaaS stand for Platform as a service 
		- Provides platform for building,testing and deploying application.
		- Infrastructure + some tools 
		- Provider providing infrastructure and maintaining that infrastructure
		- Being customer we develope our application and deploy.
		  provider will handle O.S patch,load balancing and monitoring
		- Exmple: Google app Engine,AWS Beanstalk,Microsoft Azure app service.
		
	3. SaaS
		- Saas stand for Software as a system 
		- It provides full ready to use application
		- Exmple: Gmail,office 365,dropbox,jira,service now

------------------------------------------------
Q.. Cloud deployment model?
==> Cloud deployement model defines who owns server,who manage the server and which can access that services 
	
	- There are 4 deployement models 
		1. Public Cloud 
		2. Private Cloud
		3. Hybrid Cloud
		4. Multi Cloud
		
	1. Public Cloud: Owned and managed by service provider but accessible to every one.
	
	2. Private Cloud: Owned and managed by Organization and accessible to organization users.
	
	3. Hybrid Cloud: It is combination of Public and Private cloud.
	
	4. Multi Cloud: using different service provider service at a time 
------------------------------------------------
Q.. Key benifits of Cloud Computing?
==> 1. Cost Saving
	2. On demand self services 
	3. Scalability: we can increase or decrease resources as per requirement
	4. pay-as-you-go: No need to pay advance,pay only for usage.
	5. Accibility: We can access from anywhere and any time
------------------------------------------------
Q.. List of Cloud service provider?
==> 1. AWS (amazon web services)
	2. Microsoft Azure
	3. GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
	4. Oracle Cloud
	5. IBM cloud
	6. Alibaba Cloud
	7. salesforce
	8. VMWare cloud
------------------------------------------------
Q.. What is AWS?
==> AWS stand for amazon web services 
	AWS is cloud service provider,providing IT related services over the internate
	- AWS was launched in 2006 as first public cloud services 
	- Provider with S3 and EC2 services 
	- S3 stand for Simple storage service 
	- EC2 stand for Elastic Cloud Computing
	- Nowdays AWS offer 200+ fully managed services
	- Across the globe AWS has 38+ regions and Each region has multiple availability zones 
		regions= Geographic Areas(cities)
		Availability zones=Data centers
	- In India we have 2 regions Asia Pacific(mumbai) and Asia Pacific(Hydrabad).
	  Mumbai region launched in 2016 and it has 3 availability zones 
	  Hydrabad region launched in 2022 and it has 3 availability zones 
	- AWS is market leader 
------------------------------------------------
Q.. Whose uses AWS?
==> Zomato,swiggy,Netflix,Airbnb,NASA,BMW,SBI,AXIX
------------------------------------------------
Q.. What is mean by Network?
==> Two or more devices connect with each other with or without wire.
	Devices in a network are called as nodes (e.g PC,server,printer)
	They communicate using protocols like(TCP/IP)
	Types of network are-LAN,WAN,MAN,PAN
	LAN=> Local Area Network 
	WAN=> Wide Area Network 
	MAN=> Metropolitan Area Network 
	PAN=> Personal Area Network 
------------------------------------------------
Q.. LAN network?
==> LAN stand for Local Area Network 
	Area Covered: Within a building or campus
	Example: Office or Home wifi 
------------------------------------------------
Q.. WAN network?
==> Wide Area Network 
	Area Covered: Country or Continent level 
	Example: Internet 
------------------------------------------------
Q.. MAN network?
==> MAN Stand for Metropolitan Area Network 
	Area covered : City or Large area 
	Example: city-wide cable network
------------------------------------------------
Q.. PAN network?
==> PAN stand for Personal Area Network
	Area Covered: A few meter 
	Example: Blutooth,hotspot 
------------------------------------------------
Q.. What is IP address?
==> IP address stand for Internet Protocol address
	Unique number assigned to every device connected to network.
------------------------------------------------
Q.. Types of IP address?
==> - Based on scope(usage)	
		1. Public IP 
		2. Private IP 
	
	- Based on allocation 
		1. Static IP 
		2. Dynamic IP 
		
	- Based on Version
		1. IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)
		2. IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)
------------------------------------------------
Q.. Public IP?
==> - Assigned by ISP(Internet Service Provider)
	- Public IP is the global identity of your network on the internet assigned by ISP 
	- Public IP means other devices anywhere in the world can reach you using this IP 
	- Home wifi router have public IP address like 122.176.54.23
------------------------------------------------
Q.. Private IP?
==> - Defined by IANA (Internet Assigned Number Authority) for internal use 
	- Assigned by Router/DHCP inside the network
	- A private IP is the IP address assigned to devices inside local/private network.
	- It is not routable on the internet directly work within the internal network.
	- Router,Laptop,Mobile,Printer get Private IPs
	- A Private IP is used inside local network and cannot be accessed directly from the internet.
	- For Example 1 apartment have unique flat number but not unique inside whole city 
------------------------------------------------
Q.. What is Difference between Private IP and Public IP?
==> - Public IP assigned by ISP where as Private IP are assigned by Router/DHCP inside the network 
	- Public IP work globally but Private IP work locally 
	- Public IPs are globally unique but Private IPs are not globally unique can repeat across 
	  different network
	- Public IPs are accessible from anywhere on the internet where as 
	  Private IPs not accessible from outside.
------------------------------------------------
Q.. What is Static IP?
==> -> Does not change over time
	-> manually assigned to device 
	-> useful for: servers,printers,routers
	-> static IPs are permanant ideal for hosting services 
------------------------------------------------
Q.. What is Dynamic IP?
==> -> change each time when device reconnect to network
	-> Automatically assigned by DHCP(Dynamic host configuration protocol)
	-> Dynamic IPs are temporary,cheaper and sutaible for everyday users 
------------------------------------------------
Q.. What is difference between Static IPs and Dynamic IPs?
==> Static IPs are manually assigned to device where as dynamic IPs automatically assigned by DHCP 
	- Static IPs does not change over the time where as 
	  Dynamic IP changes each time the device reconnect to the network
------------------------------------------------
Q.. What is IPv4 address?
==> IPv4 stand for Internet protocol version 4 
	- It is 32 bit number 
	- 32 bit divided into 8 octact  
	- each octact contain 8 bit 
	- One octact is seperated from another octact by using dot 
	- IP address decimal form => 192.168.1.0
