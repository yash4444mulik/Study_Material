Q.. In Parent-Child Relationship, what is table creation order?
Q.. In Parent-Child Relationship,what is data insertion order?
Q.. In Parent-Child Relationship,what is data deletion order?
Q.. In Parent-Child Relationship, what is table deletion order?
Q.. In Parent-Child Relationship, we can't delete Parent table directly,
   first we need to delete child table and then delete parent table,
   can we delete Parent table without deleting child table?How?

   in which table as foreign key?
Q.. If relation is Many to Many then which table's primary key is refered 
   in which table as foreign key?
