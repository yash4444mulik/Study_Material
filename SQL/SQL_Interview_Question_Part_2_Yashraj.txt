Q.. What is mean by Contrainst?
==> Constraint means restriction 
	constraint avoid wrong data insertion in table 
	
Q.. Why we apply constraint on column?
==> To avoid wrong data insertion in table we apply constraint on column 

Q.. What are different types of Constraints?
==> 1. primary key 
	2. foreign key 
	3. unique key 
	4. not null 
	5. default 
	6. check 

Q.. What are different Levels of Constraint?
==> 1. Column level constraint 
	1. Table level constraint 

Q.. What is mean by Column Level Constraint? 
==> constraint applied on single column is nothing but column level constraint 
	we can column level constraint using with constraint keyword or without constraint keyword

Q.. What is mean by Table Level Constraint?
==> Table level constraint means constraint applied on group of column is nothing but table level constraint
	we can Table level constraint applied using only constraint keyword.

Q.. What will happen when we don't use Constraint keyword to define Constraint?
==> then that constraint will column level constraint and internally one name assign to that constraint
	if constraint is default then no name assign to that constraint 

Q.. What will happen when we use Constraint keyword to define Constraint? 
==> if we constraint keyword to define constaint then we can happyly provide name to constraint 

Q.. What is mean by Composite Constraint?
==> constraint applied on mulitple columns is consider as composite constraint 
	

Q.. Which Constraints do we use at column level without Constraint keyword?
==> we can use all constraint at column level without constraint keyword

Q.. Which Constraints do we use at column level using Constraint keyword?
==> we can add all constraint using constraint keyword except default constraint

	primary key column does not allow duplicate values 
	primary key column does not allow null values 
	to apply primary key we use primary key keyword 
	we can apply primary key on column level without or with constraint keyword 
	we can apply composite primary key constriant 
	we can refere primary key in another table as foreign key

	unique key column allow null values 
	unique key column does not allow duplicate values 
	to apply unique key we use unique key keyword
	we can apply unique key on column level using with or wihtout constraint keyword 
	we can apply composite unique key constriant 
	we can refere unique key constriant in another table as foreign key 

Q.. What are Propeties of Foreign Key Constraint?
==> one table have one or more than one foreign key constraint 
	To apply foreign key we use foreign key or reference keyword 
	foreign key column allow null values 
	foreign key column allow duplicate values
	we can apply foreign key on column level using without constraint keyword 
	we can apply composite foreign key 

Q.. What are Propeties of NOT NULL Constraint?
==> one table have one or more than one not null constraint 
	not null column does not allow null values 
	not null column allow duplicate values 
	to apply not null constraint we use not null keyword
	we can apply column level not null constraint using with or without constraint keyword 
	we can't  apply composite not null constraint 

Q.. What are Propeties of Default Constraint?
==> one table have one or more than one default constraint
	default key constraint column allow duplicate values 
	default key constraint column allow null values
	to apply default key constraint we use default keywrod 
	we can't apply column level default key constraint using constraint keyword 
	we can apply default key constraint at column level without constraint keyword 
	we can't apply table level default constraint key 
	we can't provide name to default constraint 
	oracle does not assign any name to default constraint 
	we can't drop directly default key constraint 

Q.. What are Propeties of Check Constraint?
==> one table have one or more than one check constraint
	check constraint column  allow duplicate values 
	check constraint  column allow null values 
	to apply check constraint we use check keyword 
	we can apply column level check constraint without or with constraint keyword 
	we can apply table level check constraint 

Q.. What is difference between Primary Key and Foreign Key? 
==> - one table have only one primary key where as 
	  one table have more than one foreign key 
	- primary key column does not allow duplicate values where as 
	  foreign key column allow duplicate values
	- primary key column does not allow null values where as 
	  foreign key column allow null values 
	- to apply primary key we use primary key keyword where as 
	  to apply foreign key we use foreign key keyword 
	- we can apply column level primary key using constaint keyword where as 
	  we can't apply column level foreign key using constraint keyword 

Q.. What is difference between Primary Key and Unique Key?
==> - one table have only one primary key column where as 
	  one table have multiple unique key columns 
	- primary key column does not allow null values where as unique key column allow null values 
	- to apply primary key we use primary key keyword where as 
	  to apply unique key we use unique keyword 
	
Q.. What is difference between Unique Key and Foreign Key?
==> - unique key column does not allow duplicate values where as 
	  foreign key column allow duplicate values 
	- to apply unique key we use unique key keyword where as 
	  to apply foreign key we use foreign key or references keyword 
	- we can apply column level unique using without or with constraint keyword where as 
	  we can't apply column level foreign key using constraint keyword 

Q.. If we don't know the Constraint name,how do you find constraint name?
==> To find constraint we have table all_constraints,user_constraints,dba_constraints 
	inside table constraint name is store 
	syntax to find constraint name is 
		select * from all_constraints where table_name='table_name'

Q.. How do you find which column has which constraint?
==> To find which column has which constraint then there are 3 tables 
	1. user_constraints
	2. all_constraints
	3. dba_constraints
	to find constraint type we have syntax 
	select * from user_constraints where table_name='table_name'

Q.. How will you Drop constraint?
==> to drop constraint we have syntax 
	alter table table_name drop constraint constraint_name 

Q.. How will you disable Constraint?
==> To disable constraint we have syntax
	alter table table_name disable constraint constraint_name

Q.. How will you enable Constraint?
==> alter table table_name enable constraint constraint_name

Q.. In Parent-Child Relationship, what is table creation order?

==> first we need to delete child table data then we need to delete parent table data.

Q.. In Parent-Child Relationship, what is table deletion order?
==> first we need to delete child table then we need to delete parent table 

Q.. In Parent-Child Relationship, we can't delete Parent table directly,
   first we need to delete child table and then delete parent table,
   can we delete Parent table without deleting child table?How? 
==> yes we can delete parent table forcefully using "cascade constraint" keyword
	syntax
		drop table table_name cascade constraint

Q.. What are different types of relations?
==> one to many 
	many to one 
	many to many 
	one to one 

Q.. If relation is one to one then which table's primary key is refered in which table as foreign key?
==> one's primary key if refere in another table as foreign key but we need to apply 
	unique key constraint on that column 

Q.. If relation is one to Many then which table's primary key is refered in which table as foreign key?
==> if relation is one to many then one's primary key refer in many's table as foreign key 

Q.. If relation is Many to One then which table's primary key is refered in which table as foreign key?
==> if relation is many to one then one's primary key is refer in many's keyword as foreign key 

Q.. If relation is Many to Many then which table's primary key is refered in which table as foreign key?
==> in many to many relation both table primary key refer in third table as foreign key

   2) Foreign Key 
   => alter table table_name add clm_name data_type references table_name(clm_name);

Q.. Write a syntax to rename column.
==> alter table table_name rename column old_clm_name to new_clm_name

Q.. Can we drop table which refered in child table?
==> we can't drop parent table directly but we have another ways to drop parent table 
	1. using cascade constraint
	2. drop child table foreign key column first then drop parent table 

Q.. Can we drop a column which is refered in child table?
==> we can't drop column directly but we have another ways to drop column

	2. using cascade constraint

==> we can't drop constraint directly but we have another ways to drop constraint 
	1. drop child constraint first then drop parent constraint
