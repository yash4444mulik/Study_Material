============ C-Language ==================

Q.. What is C-Language?
==> C-Language is most popular and widely used programming language 
	C introduced in 1972 by Denis Ritchic at Bell lab in USA.
	we use turbo c compiler to compile C-Language
	
	
Q.. What is int?
==> int is used to store number;
	int size is 2 byte in turbo c means 2byte=16bits 2^16-1
	

Q.. what is float variable?
==> it is variable used to store floating numbers.
	float size is 4 byte in turbo c means 4byte=32bits 2*32-1
	

Q.. What is char variable?
==> char is used to store character type value 
	default size of char is 1
	
	
Q.. What is #include <stdio.h>
==> it is preprocessor that told to compiler to include standard input output 
	header file before compiling program.
	- As per ANSI this is not mandatarto to use while return the program
	
Q.. what is void main?
==> void main is function which is said that it is start of our function 
	{} inside curly bracker we write our statements 

Q.. What is printf()?
==> printf is command in C-Language which help us to disply some content on screen 

Q.. What is getch()?
==> getch() stand for get character. it store execution of program untill we doesn't 
	provide any character to it.
	
Q.. what is comment in c-language?
==> comment is non-executable part in c-language.
	commented part is ingore by compiler while executation of code 
	there are 2 type of comment in c-language
	1. single line comment => //
	2. multi line comment => /* -------- */
	
Q.. what are different types of operator?
==> 1. arthimatic operator 
	2. logical operator 
	3. comparison operator 
	4. bitwise operator 
	5. assignment operator
	
Q.. what are arithmatic operator?
==> Arithmatic operator are those operand which perform arthimatic operations 
	like 
		+ addition
		- substraction 
		/ division 
		* multiplication 
		% modulo 
	   ++ increment 
		-- decrement 
		
Q.. What is token in c-language?
==> token is building block of c-language.
	token is smallest unit of code that can compiler recognize and understand.
	there are different type of compiler in c-language
		1. indentifier 
		2. keywords 
		3. constants 
		4. strings 
		5. operator 
		6. symbols 
		
Q.. What are type of control flow statement?
==> 1. if statement 
	2. if else statement 
	3. switch statement 
	4. loop (for,while,do-while)
	
Q.. what is if statement?
==> if is constrol flow statement used to execute block of block of code repetatively 

	if(condition)
	{
	
	}

Q.. what is if else statement?
==> if else is constrol flow statement used to execute block of block of code repetatively
	Syntax: 
		if(condition){
			//block of code 
		}
		else{
			//block of code 
		}
		
		
Q.. what is switch statement?
==> switch statement is used to perform different action based on different condition.
	switch statement evalute once 
	if value of expression is match then execute perticular block of code 
	if there is no match then it execute default block of code 
	
	switch (condition){
		case value: 
		//block of code 
		break;
		case value 2: 
		//block of code 
		break;
		default 
		//block of code 	
	}
	
Q.. loops (for,while,do-while)?
==> 
	1. for loop?
	==> for loop is control flow statement used to excute block of code repetatively.
	syntax: 
		for(expression1;expression2;expression3)
		{
		//block of code
		}
		
		expression1 stand for declaration and initilization.
		expression2 stand for loop counter.
		expression3 stand for increment and decrement.
		
	2. while loop?
	==> while loop is control flow statment used to execute perticular block of code 
	
		while(condition){
		//block of code
		
		}
		
	3. do while loop?
	==> do while is control flow statment used to execute perticular block of code 
	
		do{
		//block of code 
		}
		while (condition){
		//block of code 
		}
