	=> 	- debouncing is used to improve the perfomance by controlling the time when
		  function should be executed.
		- debouncing accept function and transform it into updated function so that code inside the 
		  function is executed after some time 
		- if debounced function is called again within that period the previous timer is reset and 
		  new timer is started for function call

	Q. what is difference between array and object?	Q. what is difference between spread and rest operator?
	=> - array is collection of value where as object is collection of key value pair 	=> spread operator is used to expand element from an iterable element such as array,object,string into 
	   - array is denoted by [] where as object is denoted by {}	   individual elements.
	   - element in the array is ordered where as element in the object are not ordered	    where as 
	 		rest operator is used in function parameter to collect all remaining argument in an array.
	Q. what is higher order function?		
	=> higher order function take one or more function as an argument or return a function as a result.		Example:-
				let array=[1,2,3];
	Q. what is difference between argument and parameter?			console.log(...array);//this is spread operator output is 1,2,3
	=> parameter are the placeholder defined in the function declaration			
		where as argument is the actual value that passed to function when it called 			display(1,2,3,4,5,6)//this is display function 
					function display(first, second, ...restArguments) {
						console.log(first);
	Q. What are the event in JS?how event triggered?			console.log(second);
	=> Event is nothing but change in state of object.			console.log(restArguments[0]); // Third argument
		event triggering=> 1. user intract with web page and click on event 			console.log(restArguments[1]); // Fourth argument
							2. then event handler is occure 			console.log(restArguments[2]); // Fifth argument
							3. then event handler handle the event and event handler function 			console.log(restArguments[3]); // Sixth argument
								that have block of code 			}
							4. the page appearance is updated/modified in some way as a result.	
					
	Q. what is difference between primitive and non primitive data types?
	=> primitive data types hold single value where as non primitive data type hold multiple values 
	Q. What is event object in JS?		primitive data type are immutable where as non primitive data type are mutable
	=> - whenever event is triggered,the browser automatically creates an event object and passess		primitive data type are simple data type where as non primitive data type are complex data type.
		it as an argument to the event handler function 		
	   - the event object contains various properties method that provide information about the 		
	     event such as the type of event,the element that triggered the event etc.				
				
			
			Q. What is callback in js?
	Q. What is event delegation/capturing in JS?	=> function which is pass to another function as an argument is nothing but callback 
	=> event delegation is process where you can add single event on parent element that handle 	   function 
		all child element	   
			  
		Example:- 
			Q. What is closure in js?
			=> closure is javascript function in that inner function has access variable and parameter of its outer function 
			<ul id="myList">	
						<li>List One</li>		for example
						<li>List Two</li>			
						<li>List Three</li>			const parent = (y)=>{
					</ul>				let name='yashraj';
									
				JAVASCRIPT				const child = ()=>{
							console.log(name);
					let parentEvent=document.getElementById('myList');				}
				return child
					parentEvent.addEventListener("click",handleOnClick);			}
								const result=parent();
					function handleOnClick(event)			result();
					{	   
						let target=event.target;	
						console.log("clicked"+target.textContent);	Q. What is setTimeout in js?
					}	=> setTimeout is used to execute code asynchronously after a delay
		- syntax:- setTimeout(function,time)
		- it accept two parameter first is function.second is time in milisecond.
				- after the execution it return timer id 
	Q. What is event bubbling in Js?		- setTimeout run once
	=> event bubbling is the process that event triggered on child that propaget up DOM tree,		
	   triggering event handle on its parent.		
	   		
	   Example		
					Q. What is setInterval in js?
				<div id="parent">	=> setInterval is used to execute code asynchronously after a delay 
					<div id="sparent">		- syntax:- setInterval(function,time)
						<button id="child">Click Me</button>		- it accept two parameter first is function and second is time in milisecond.
					</div>		- after the execution it return number 
				</div>		- setInterval run repeatedly.
								
					Q. What is Asynchronous?
	   	=> Function are running in parallel with other function are called Aysynchrounous.
				let third=document.getElementById('child');		- good example is setTimeout and setInterval.
				let second=document.getElementById('sParent');		- in asynchronous one function has to wait for other function (like waiting for 
				let first=document.getElementById('parent');		  a file to load)
						
				second.addEventListener('click',handleOnChange);	Q. What is object?
				first.addEventListener('click',handleOnChange);	=> group of multiple value together in key-value pairs
				third.addEventListener('click',handleOnChange);	
					Q. How to define object?
				function handleOnChange(event)	=> to define object we use curly bracket{} 
				{		- let obj_name={
					console.log("captured id =>" + this.id);						key1:value,
				}						key2:value2,
						key3:value3
	   						}
	Q. How to stop event propagation and event bubbling in JS?		- key and value is seperated using colon ':'
	=> event bubbling can stopped by calling stopPropagation() method on event.		- each key and value pair is seperated using comma ','
						- key name should be unique but value is duplicate.
				let third=document.getElementById('child');		- if value is string then enclose in single or doubble quote.
				let second=document.getElementById('sParent');		
				let first=document.getElementById('parent');	Q. What is JSON?=> read from react file 
					
				second.addEventListener('click',handleOnChange);	Q. what is key difference in json and javascript object?
				first.addEventListener('click',handleOnChange);		- in json key can be inclose in quote but in javascript object key is unquoted.
				third.addEventListener('click',handleOnChange);		- javascript object have function and other complex data types as values but json 
						  has a limited set of data types,including strings,numbers,booleans,arrays,object 
				function handleOnChange(event)		  and null.
				{		- javascript object are used within a javascript program to structure and organize data 
					console.log("captured id =>" + this.id);		  but json is used for data interchange between different systems 
					event.stopPropagation();		- json.stringify() method is used to convert javascript object to json and 
				}		  json.parse() method is used to convert json into javascript object.
			  
	Q. What is event capturing/deligation in JS?	Q. what is mean by Autoboxing?
	=> event capturing is the process in javascript where event handling starting from parent to target element.	=> automatic conversion of primitive data types(string,boolean,number) to object is
				let third=document.getElementById('child');	   nothing but Autoboxing.
				let second=document.getElementById('sParent');	   
				let first=document.getElementById('parent');	
					Q. what is mean by Auto-unboxing?
				second.addEventListener('click',handleOnChange,true);	=> Automatic conversion of object to primitive nothing but Auto-unboxing.
				first.addEventListener('click',handleOnChange,true);	
				third.addEventListener('click',handleOnChange,true);	Q. What is Typecasting in javascript?
					=> Typecasting means changing one data type into another data type.
				function handleOnChange(event)	   - there are two typecast 
				{	   - 1. implicit type conversion 
					console.log("captured id =>" + this.id);			=> conversion occurs automatically during the execution of an operation.
						     2. explicit type conversion 
				}			=> the developer explicitly converting a value from one type to another 
				   using built-in function nothing but explicit type conversion.
	Q. What is event.preventDefault() in js?			   
	=> event.preventDefault() method is used to prevent default behaviour of an event and the link click 	Q. What is mean by Synchronous?
	   will be prevented 	=> synchronous means the code runs in a perticular sequence of intructions given in 
	   the program.
	   - each intruction wait for the previous intruction to complete its execution.
	   
	Q. What is Asynchronous?

		  contineu statement is used to skip current iteration of the loop and 
		  move on to the next iteration 
		  
		
	- What is difference between map() and forEach() method?
	=> map() method is used to read and itereate an array and it create new array as result 
		where as forEach() method use to read an array and perform some operation on it without 
		creating new array
	
				 

	Q. What is callback in js?
	=> function which is pass to another function as an argument is nothing but callback 
	   function 
		
		
		
		
		
	- What is difference between break,return,contineu?
	=>	- break keyword is used to terminate the loop whereas 
		  contineu keyword is used to stop the current execution and move on next execution 
		  return keyword is used to stop the execution and return the value 
		  
		 	Q. What is setTimeout in js?
	=> setTimeout is used to execute code asynchronously after a delay

		- after the execution it return number 
		- setInterval run repeatedly.
		
	Q. How to stop execution in setInterval?
	=> 	by using clearTimeout(timeoutId) method.
		 it accept one input argument i.e timeoutid 
		
	Q. What is Asynchronous?
	=> Function are running in parallel with other function are called Aysynchrounous.
		- good example is setTimeout and setInterval.
		- in asynchronous one function has to wait for other function (like waiting for 
		  a file to load)
		
	Q. What is object?
	=> group of multiple value together in key-value pairs nothing but object.
	
	Q. How to define object?

		- let obj_name={
						key1:value,
						key2:value2,
						key3:value3
						}
		- key and value is seperated using colon ':'
		- each key and value pair is seperated using comma ','
		- key name should be unique but value is duplicate.
		- if value is string then enclose in single or doubble quote.
	
	
	Q. how many ways to create object?
	=> there are three way to create an object 
		1. Object Literals 
			syntax:- 	var person={
								name:'yash',
								age:23
								}
								
		2. Object Constructor 
			syntax:- 	var person=new Object()
						person.name="yash";
						person.age=23
						
		3. Object Create() method

	Q. What is callback hell?
	=> nested callback stacked below one another forming pyramid structure.
	
	Q. what is need of promises?
	=> with asynchronous we can execute multiple tasks in parallel but 
	   asynchronous programmes are difficult to write and difficult to debug 
	   - because of this modern asynchronous javascript methods don't use callbacks.
	     asynchronous programming problem is solved using promises.

	Q. What is promises in javascript?
	=> - promise introduced in ES-6 i.e 2015 
	   - used to handle asynchronous operations effectively.
	   - promise provide a way to deal with operations that may take some time to 
	     complete,such as fetching data from server,reading a file,or any other 
		 asynchronous task.
	   - Promise has 3 stages 
			1. pending :- this is initial state means promises neither fullfilled or rejectd.
			2. fullfilled/resolved :- operation successfully completed and promise resulting 
									  value
			3. rejected :- the operation failed and the promise has a reason for the failure.
	   - promise has 2 properties (state,result)
	     state can 'pending','fullfilled' or 'reject'
			if state is pending then result is undefined
			if state is fullfilled then result is value 
			if state is reject then result is error object 
	   - we can't access the properties directly but we can access through method and 
		 these method as below 
		 promiseObj.then(),promiseObj.catch(),promiseObj.finally() are method to handle 
		 the promise.
	
	Q. how to create promise?
	=>  - we can create promise object using promise constructor 
		- syntax :- 
					const myPromise=new Promise(executorFunction);
		
			
		  
		 
	
		

	- What is difference between break,return,contineu?
	=>	- break keyword is used to terminate the loop whereas 
		  contineu keyword is used to stop the current execution and move on next execution 
		  return keyword is used to stop the execution and return the value 
		  
		  
	- What is difference between do while() loop and while() loop?
	=> 	- while loop execute when condition is true where as 
		  do_while() loop execute at least one time if condition is false 
		  
	
	- what is difference between break and contineu statement?
	=> 	- break statement is used to terminate the loop where as 
		  contineu statement is used to skip current iteration of the loop and 
		  move on to the next iteration

What debugger can do in in javascript?
- it is act as breakpoint in js 


What is DOM 
- dom stand for document object model
- dom is w3c(world wide web consortium) standard	
- dom is standard object model and programming interface for HTML
- in dom every element is consider as object 
- dom provide method to access html element
- dom provide properties for html element
- in short html dom is a standard for how to get,change,add or delete HTML element

	



Finding of HTML element using dom 
- We can find html element using 
	1. id attribute value 
	2. class attribute value 
	3. tag name 
	
    1. finding of html element on the basis of id 
	- if we want to access html element on the basis of id attribute value then 
	  method is getElementById()
	- How to call getElementById()
	   document.getElementById(id value);
	- if element is found then getElementById() method return that element.
	- if element is not found then getElementById() method return null.
	
	2. Finding of html element on the basis of tag name.
	- if we want to find html element on the basis of tag name then method is 
	  getElementByTagName(tag_name);
	- How to call getElementByTagName();
	   document.getElementByTagName(tag_name);
	- if element is found then this method returns list of element and we can 
	  access that using index basis 
	  
	3. Finding of html element on the basis of class name.
	- if we want to find html element on the basis of class name then method is 
	  getElementByClassName(class_name);
	- if element is found then it return list of element
		
	
-------------------------------------------------	
	
what is innerHTML?
		=>  1) You can use it to get the internal HTML content of any HTML element as an HTML string. 2) You can also use it to set or change elements' innerHTML content.
